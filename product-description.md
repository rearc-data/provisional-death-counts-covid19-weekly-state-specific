The source code outlining how this product gathers, transforms, revises and publishes its datasets is avaiable at [https://github.com/rearc-data/provisional-death-counts-covid19-weekly-state-specific](https://github.com/rearc-data/provisional-death-counts-covid19-weekly-state-specific).

## Main Description
Provisional death counts are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. Data may be incomplete and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Dataset is revised weekly and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.

#### Data Sources  
Provisional death counts are based on death records received and processed by NCHS as of a specified cutoff date. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period especially for more recent periods. Estimates of completeness are provided. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.

The columns in this dataset are:  
`State, Indicator, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black or African American, Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Other`
